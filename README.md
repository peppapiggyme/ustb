# UltraSound ToolBox (USTB) #

An open source (although not just yet) MATLAB toolbox for beamforming, processing and visualization of ultrasonic signals. The USTB is developed and supported by the Department of Circulation and Medical Imaging (ISB) of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), but we have collaborators from:

- InPhase Solutions AS (http://www.inphase.no/)
- The University of Oslo (http://www.uio.no/)

### What is this repository for? ###

* Beamforming, processing, and visualization of ultrasonic signals.
* We have two concurrent versions (sorry):
    * __v1.9.x__ is in beta and shows the basic functionality of USTB for STAI, CPWI, and DW
    * __v2.0.x__ is in early alfa and redefines the paradigm of beamforming with an unified beamforming code. It also supports HUFF (HDF5 Ultrasound File Format).

### How do I get set up? ###

* Just clone the repository and add the folder (without subfolders) to MATLAB's path
