# UltraSound ToolBox (USTB) #

An open source MATLAB toolbox for beamforming, processing, and visualization of ultrasonic signals. The USTB is developed as a joint effort of the Department of Circulation and Medical Imaging (ISB) of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (https://www.ntnu.no/isb), and the Department of Informatics of the University of Oslo (http://www.uio.no/).

* Beamforming, processing, and visualization of ultrasonic signals.
* Current version __v1.9.x__ is in beta and shows the basic functionality of USTB for STAI, CPWI, and DW.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Just clone the repository and add the folder (without subfolders) to MATLAB's path
