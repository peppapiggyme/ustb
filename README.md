# UltraSound ToolBox (USTB) #

An open source (although not just yet) MATLAB toolbox for beamforming, processing and visualization of ultrasonic signals. The USTB is developed and supported by the Department of Circulation and Medical Imaging (ISB) of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (https://www.ntnu.no/isb), but we have collaborators from:

- InPhase Solutions AS (http://www.inphase.no/)
- The University of Oslo (http://www.uio.no/)

### What is this repository for? ###

* Beamforming, processing, and visualization of ultrasonic signals.
* Current version __v1.9.x__ is in beta and shows the basic functionality of USTB for STAI, CPWI, and DW

### How do I get set up? ###

* Just clone the repository and add the folder (without subfolders) to MATLAB's path

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Alfonso Rodriguez-Molares <alfonso.r.molares@ntnu.no> is the project manager,
* Other collaborators are:
    * Øyvind Krøvel-Velle Standal <oyvind.standal@inphase.no>,
    * Jochen Rau <jochen.rau@inphase.no>,
    * Lasse Løvstakken <lasse.lovstakken@ntnu.no>,
    * Ingvild Kinn Ekroll <ingvild.k.ekroll@ntnu.no>,
