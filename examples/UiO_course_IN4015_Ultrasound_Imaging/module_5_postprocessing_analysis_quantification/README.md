# Module 5 - Postprocessing analysis quantification
This example and exercise demonstrates what we in the USTB defines as
postprocessing processing objects. Thus, how one can work with the
delayed data after beamforming. More specific we are going to look at
coherent and incoherent compounding of individual plane wave images.
When you do plane wave imaging you can create one low quality image
from each transmit. These low quality images can be combined together
to create images of higher quality. We will explore this in this
exercise.

## Litterature:
See section 1.7.3 and 1.7.4 in the compendium "Software Beamforming in Medical Ultrasound Imaging". 


## The exercise:
### Part I
Implement both coherent compounding and incoherent
compounding of the individual plane wave images. You can read about
coherent and incoherent compounding in section 1.7.3 and 1.7.4 in
the compendium "Software Beamforming in Medical Ultrasound Imaging"

### Part II
Comparing your implementation to the USTB implementation.
       
### Part III
Implement a mix of coherent and incoherent compounding.

### Part IV
Compare the resoluting resolution from coherent, incoherent and mixed compounding.
Discuss how the different compounding strategies influenced the resolution
of the point scatter at line 191.
