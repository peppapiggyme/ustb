# Module 2 : Wave Physics

The lab assignment for **Module 2** is to run a K-wave simulation of a single 
source and do receive beamforming on the signals using the USTB, as well as 
implementing the delay calculations for a "stripped down" beamformer implementation.

In the report you need to reflect and answer the following questions:

+ What happens when you change the number of sensors from 4 to 16?
+ What happens when you change the transmit signal from *gauusian_pulse* to *sinus*?
+ What is illustrated in Figure 10? Explain the images and how they differ from the final image.
