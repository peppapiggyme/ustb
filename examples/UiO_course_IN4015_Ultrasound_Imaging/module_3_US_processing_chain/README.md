# Module 3 : US Processing Chain

The lab assignment for **Module 3** is to implement your own beamforming from
scratch. In contrast to the beamforming in Module 2, where we used pixel based
beamforming, for the received part of the propagation delay. We are now taking
both the receive and the transmit part of the propagation delay into account.

In addition we will no longer use the pixel based beamforming, but rather use
beambased beamforming. Meaning that we are now looking into using the angles and
distance to find the positions, rather than the predefined pixels like in module
2.

Your method would then be compared to USTB built in method, in this module we
are aiming to minimize the difference between your method and USTBs method.
Finally we will implement your method to make your own image.
