# Module 3 : US Processing Chain

The lab assignment for **Module 3** is to implement your own beamforming from
scratch. In Module 2, we used pixel based beamforming, calculating the
propagation delay one way, the recieve delay. In this module, we are taking
both the receive delay and the transmit deay of the total propagation delay
into account, using beambased beamforming. This means that we are now using
angles and distance to find the positions, rather than the predefined pixels
as we did in Module 2.

After your implementation of the total propagation delay, your method will
be compared to USTB built in method. In this module we are aiming to minimize
the difference between your method and USTBs method. Finally we will implement
your method to make your own image.


## Litterature


## The exercise:
### Part I
Do phased array beamforming with the USTB

### Part II
Implement your own beambased beamforming from scratch.
